        "#OOPS\n",
        "1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of writing programs that organizes code into objects, which represent real-world entities. Each object contains data, called attributes, and functions, called methods, that define its behavior. The main principles of OOP are encapsulation (keeping data and methods together), abstraction (hiding unnecessary details), inheritance (reusing code by deriving new classes from existing ones), and polymorphism (using the same method in different ways depending on the object). This approach makes programs easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class in OOP is a blueprint or template used to create objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from it will have. In simple terms, a class is like a plan or design, while objects are the actual items built using that plan.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object in OOP is an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity. It contains specific values for the attributes defined in the class and can perform actions using the methods of the class. In simple terms, if a class is the blueprint, then an object is the actual product created from that blueprint.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object, while encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together within a class and restricting direct access to some parts of the object. In simple terms, abstraction focuses on **what** an object does, and encapsulation focuses on **how** the data and methods are protected and organized.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods in Python, also called **magic methods** or **special methods**, are built-in methods that start and end with double underscores (`__method__`). They allow you to define how objects of a class should behave with Python’s built-in operations. For example, `__init__` is used for initializing objects, `__str__` is used to define how an object is represented as a string, and `__add__` can be used to customize the behavior of the `+` operator. In short, dunder methods let you make your classes act more like built-in types.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOPS?\n",
        "- Inheritance in OOP is the concept that allows one class (called the **child class** or **subclass**) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (called the **parent class** or **superclass**). It promotes code reuse, as the child class does not need to rewrite the code already present in the parent class. The child class can also add its own features or override the parent class’s methods to provide specific behavior. In simple terms, inheritance creates a relationship of “is-a” between classes, such as a `Dog` class inheriting from an `Animal` class, meaning a dog **is an** animal.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism in OOP is the ability of a single function, method, or operator to behave differently based on the object it is acting upon. It allows the same interface or method name to be used for different underlying data types or classes. For example, a method called `makeSound()` could produce a bark for a `Dog` object and a meow for a `Cat` object. In simple terms, polymorphism means \"many forms,\" and it helps make code more flexible and reusable.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved by restricting direct access to the attributes and methods of a class and controlling it through public methods. This is mainly done using **access modifiers**: attributes without underscores are public, attributes with a single leading underscore (`_variable`) are treated as protected (a convention to show they shouldn’t be accessed directly), and attributes with double leading underscores (`__variable`) are name-mangled to make them private. To interact with these hidden variables, getter and setter methods (or Python’s `@property` decorator) are commonly used. This way, the internal state of an object is protected and can only be modified in controlled ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "-A constructor in Python is a special method called **`__init__`** that is automatically executed when an object of a class is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the object’s attributes with specific values. For example, in a `Car` class, the constructor can set the car’s color and model when a new `Car` object is made. In short, the constructor prepares and sets up the object right at the time of creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- A class method in Python is a method that works with the class itself rather than individual objects, and it is defined using the `@classmethod` decorator with `cls` as its first parameter. A static method is a method that does not depend on either the class or its objects, and it is defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator without `self` or `cls`. In simple terms, class methods can modify class-level data, while static methods are utility functions that logically belong to the class but do not access class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "-Method overloading in Python refers to defining multiple methods with the same name but different numbers or types of parameters. Unlike some other languages, Python does not support true method overloading because the latest defined method with the same name will override the previous ones. However, similar behavior can be achieved by using default arguments, variable-length arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`), or conditional logic inside a single method to handle different types or numbers of inputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding in OOP occurs when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The method in the child class must have the same name and parameters as the one in the parent class, and when the method is called on a child object, the child’s version is executed instead of the parent’s. This allows a subclass to modify or extend the behavior of its parent class’s methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- A property decorator in Python, written as `@property`, is used to define a method in a class that can be accessed like an attribute. It allows you to implement **getter, setter, and deleter** functionality in a clean way without explicitly calling methods. With `@property`, you can make an attribute read-only, control how its value is set, or add validation when modifying it, while still accessing it like a normal variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.Why is polymorphism important in OOPS?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is important in OOP because it allows the same operation or method name to work in different ways depending on the object it is applied to. This makes code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain since a single interface can handle multiple underlying forms. It also supports extensibility, meaning new classes can be added with their own implementations without changing existing code, which leads to better scalability and cleaner program design.\n",
        "\n",
        "15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to serve as a blueprint for other classes. It can contain abstract methods, which are methods declared but not implemented, forcing any subclass to provide their own implementation. Abstract classes are defined using the `abc` (Abstract Base Class) module with the `ABC` class and the `@abstractmethod` decorator. They are useful for enforcing a common structure across multiple subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- The advantages of OOP are that it makes code more **modular**, since classes group data and behavior together; it improves **reusability**, because inheritance allows existing code to be reused in new classes; it provides **flexibility and extensibility**, since polymorphism lets the same interface work with different objects; it ensures better **security and control**, through encapsulation that hides and protects data; and it makes programs **easier to understand, maintain, and scale**, as real-world entities are modeled directly as objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "-  A class variable is a variable that is shared by all objects of a class, meaning it has the same value for every instance unless explicitly changed at the class level. An instance variable, on the other hand, is unique to each object and is defined inside the constructor using `self`, so different objects can have different values for the same attribute. In short, class variables belong to the class itself, while instance variables belong to individual objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class at the same time. This means the child class can access attributes and methods from all its parent classes. While it promotes code reuse, it can also lead to complexity, especially when two parent classes have methods with the same name, which Python resolves using the **Method Resolution Order (MRO)**.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "- The `__str__` method in Python is used to define a human-readable string representation of an object, which is what gets shown when you use `print()` on the object. The `__repr__` method is meant to provide an unambiguous string representation of the object, often one that could be used to recreate the object, and it is shown when you inspect the object directly in the interpreter. In short, `__str__` is for users, while `__repr__` is for developers and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The `super()` function in Python is used to call methods from a parent class inside a child class. Its main significance is that it allows a subclass to reuse and extend the functionality of its parent class without having to refer to the parent class name directly. This makes code easier to maintain, supports multiple inheritance by following the method resolution order (MRO), and ensures that the correct parent method is called automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The `__del__` method in Python is known as the **destructor**, and it is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed. Its significance is that it allows you to define cleanup actions, such as closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from a database, before the object is removed from memory. However, it is used rarely because Python has automatic garbage collection, and relying too much on `__del__` can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior if objects are part of circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- The difference between `@staticmethod` and `@classmethod` in Python is that a static method does not take any reference to the class or object as its first argument, while a class method takes the class itself (`cls`) as its first argument. A static method behaves like a normal function placed inside a class for logical grouping and cannot access or modify class or instance data. A class method, on the other hand, can access and modify class-level variables and is often used for creating alternative constructors or working with class-wide data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "-  Polymorphism in Python with inheritance works by allowing a child class to provide its own version of a method that already exists in the parent class. When an object of the child class is used, the overridden method in the child class is called instead of the parent’s version, even if the object is referenced using the parent class type. This way, the same method name can perform different actions depending on the class of the object, making the code more flexible and extensible.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, one after another. This works by having each method return the object itself, usually by returning `self`, so that another method can be called immediately. It improves readability and allows writing concise, fluent-style code, such as `obj.method1().method2().method3()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The `__call__` method in Python allows an object of a class to be called like a function. By defining this method, you can make an instance behave as if it were a regular function, executing the code inside `__call__` whenever the object is invoked with parentheses. Its purpose is to add flexibility and make objects more functional, often used in cases like creating function wrappers, decorators, or classes that need callable behavior.\n"
